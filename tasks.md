3. **Implement history tracking**: Store a persistent history of all LLM callouts, responses, and settings in a shared history module that can be accessed by all extensions. You can extend your LLM Core Interface to include methods for recording and retrieving this history. - WE are going to store everything in json files in the open project folder. This makes the history available to all extensions and also allows the user to easily access the history files. 

4. **Expose LLM Core Interface & implementations through a shared module**: Create a shared module that can be imported by all the extensions to access the LLM Core Interface and its implementations for different LLMs. This module should also expose the methods for managing available LLMs and interacting with their history.

```typescript
class LLMCoreManager {
  registerCore(core: LLMCoreInterface): void;
  getCore(name: string): LLMCoreInterface | undefined;
}

const LLMManagerInstance = new LLMCoreManager();

export { LLMCoreInterface, GPT4Core, LLMManagerInstance };
```

5. **Ensure extensibility**: To support potential multiple LLM implementations, ensure that the LLM Core Interface and the shared module are designed in a manner that does not limit future implementation or addition of new LLM providers.

6. **VS Code extension registration**: To make the LLM Core Interface and its implementations available to other VS Code extensions, implement an inter-extension communication method that registers an instance of LLM Core Manager (`LLMManagerInstance`) as a shared resource (e.g., using `vscode.ExtensionContext`).

7. **Core functionality**: Finally, you can further extend the LLM Core Interface or the LLM Core Manager to provide additional functionality, such as querying installed extensions, LLM-specific settings, or providing helper methods for easier integration with VS Code extensions.
