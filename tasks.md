5. **Ensure extensibility**: To support potential multiple LLM implementations, ensure that the LLM Core Interface and the shared module are designed in a manner that does not limit future implementation or addition of new LLM providers.

6. **VS Code extension registration**: To make the LLM Core Interface and its implementations available to other VS Code extensions, implement an inter-extension communication method that registers an instance of LLM Core Manager (`LLMManagerInstance`) as a shared resource (e.g., using `vscode.ExtensionContext`).

7. **Core functionality**: Finally, you can further extend the LLM Core Interface or the LLM Core Manager to provide additional functionality, such as querying installed extensions, LLM-specific settings, or providing helper methods for easier integration with VS Code extensions.
