# Puck Core

Puck Core is the central component of the Puck AI suite of Visual Studio Code extensions. This powerful project provides seamless communication with the large language model (LLM) that powers the entire system. Built on top of OpenAI's GPT-4, Puck Core enables developers to take advantage of a wide range of AI-driven tools and functionalities.

## Features

Puck Core serves as the foundation for several child extensions, including:

- **Conversation Documents**: Create and manage interactive conversation documents with ease.
- **Project Agents**: Collaborate with AI agents to get assistance and suggestions for your projects.
- **Smart Terminal**: A terminal that can code and fix bugs for you.
- **AI-Driven Applications**: Use talkdown - a language based on markdown - to create AI-driven applications with Puck.
- **And Many More**: Discover additional extensions and tools that leverage the power of Puck Core.

## Getting Started

To get started with Puck Core, you'll need to install the main extension and any desired child extensions from the Visual Studio Code marketplace. Once installed, Puck Core automatically handles the communication between your environment and the GPT-4 LLM.
